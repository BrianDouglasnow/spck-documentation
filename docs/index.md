### Diffs

File diffing is an awesome feature that any code editor needs. Features are a bit lacking in Spck Editor's code differ, but hopefully more features will be added to the differ in the near future. Some planned features are char-by-char diffs as well as in-place editting.

### Search

Project-wide code searching is a useful tool for any JavaScript development. Navigating between files by keywords and refactoring are all made easier with an awesome fast search feature. There's still room to improve with the editor's search, so we need your [feedback](https://github.com/spckio/spck-issues) on any ideas to improve the editor!

### Live Preview

Live previewing is a feature so essential, its barely worth mentioning. However... Spck Editor supports two modes of previewing, in a separate browser tab as well as an inline iframe for quicker edits-to-preview.

Additionally, previewing also work great in Spck Editor's mobile app. So if your interested in giving JavaScript development a try on your mobile device, be sure to download our [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck&hl=en_CA&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).
