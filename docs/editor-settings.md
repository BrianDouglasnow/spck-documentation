# Editor Settings

Yay! This is a page dedicated to describing the long, tedious, and complex settings to use the editor. Hence, the name of this section. Nah, I promsie it won't be that bad. In fact, settings in [Spck Editor](https://spck.io) are fairly straightforward (hopefully).

### Appearance

* __Animation__: Enables or disables most CSS animations. Disable editor animations if they are running slow on your device. Results in better performance and faster transitions.

* __Theme__: Changes the colors of the code editor. Dark and light editor theme are tied with this setting.

### Editor

* __Check Syntax__: Creates a web worker to check the syntax of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Other languages may or may not be supported for syntax checking.

* __Font Size__: Changes the font size of the code editor.

* __Indent Guides__: Adds indent guidelines to the code editor for visual guidance.

* __Line Numbers__: Toggles the line numbers in the code editor.

* __Tab Size__: Changes the number of spaces a tab represents in the code editor.

* __Word Wrap__: Toggles soft line wraps in the code editor.

*Note: These settings affect both the main editor as well as the diff editor.*

### Touch

* __Touch Features__: Toggles on and off all touch features. This includes touch primary keyboard, files touch mode, and other touch features for the code editor.

* __Extra Touch Keyboard__: Toggles the extra touch keyboard which contains key options for common code keywords and symbols.

*Note: These settings are only available on devices with a touch screen.*
